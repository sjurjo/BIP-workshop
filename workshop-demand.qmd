-   REDUCE the fade out of workshops.

-   Be confident - only one way of doing this workshop

-   Parking lot - save issues so they feel heard and makes them more relaxed during the work session




## Meeting your military work demands {.smaller background-color="#604461"}

### Todays topics for discussion

**What** are your working demands in your position?

**How** will you achieve these working demands?

**Why** is this of importance?



::: notes

-   *What* are the working demand related to strength, endurance, technical, coordination, power.

    -   Can you justify that - what are you doing? If not think of which speciality / fields may you have in the future?

-   *How* will you achieve these working demands?

    -   Put up a training plan adjusted for these goals, work with cadets from your nation

-   *Why* is this of importance?

    - why is this of importance, which is related to your military readiness...
    
    And we will also discuss if / or is there a difference between test fitness and physical / functional fitness in a military context...

### Physical Performance Continuum

::: notes

First let us take a brief recap of what I talked about last lecture about working demands, physical fitness and military readiness.

1. From this figure it summarizes a your yourney as a soldiers related to **physical employment standards**. With that i mean, you need to reach a baseline standard of physical fitness that increases your performance level in either physical or occupational task performance. This is a level you pursue during your academy training.

2. The next progression step, is to get you as soldier deployment ready / mission ready... Here you will additionally focus your training more on your occupational demands that you will meet when you deploy... called pre-deployment preparation...

3. Then when you are assumed deployment ready your performance level is high and your have optimized your military readiness..

4- Then during your deployment you will experience these drop in performance level, due to the stress factors we talked about last lecture... show next slide and explain..

5. then to re-establish performance you return to the preparation phase and so you move along your carrer.









- You are able to meet the occupational demands, which demands a level of physical fitness. This is of importance to prevent MSI..
  - Focus on developing occupationlly-relevant physical capacitites to improve occupational performance, and reduce MSKI risk, rather than focus on task performance (e.g. load carriage).
  
- Consider implementing physical employment standard as maximal performance tests, rather than dichotomous pass/fail tests, to better understand the relationship between occupationally-relevant physical capacity and MSKI risk. 

-   Development of coherent, well characterized physical training continuum, inclusive of both physical training and psychological is critical to the optimal development and maintenance of workforce performance capacity.

- Physical training, PES and MSKI prevention strategies are co-dependent factors, and central to organisational capability within physically demanding occupations.

::: {.notes}

- As I talked about last lecture on Sunday, we see this drop both following field exercise studies (especial) and deployment studies of different durations...


- Post deploymet is something we have good evidence for. There will be a drop in physical fitness and performance following deployment studies. How large depends on stressfactors and duration of operations...


- Explain figure.. 

- There is a variations in changes between the studies, due to differences in duration, energy deficit, recovery, sampling time points.. So both physiological changes but also methodological differences (that must be kept in mind when comparing such studies, such as this plot)..

- Factors affecting soldiers training adaptations and<br> performance development

![](fig/ex_envir1.png){.fragment .absolute top=-80 right=-30 height="280"}



::: notes

..THROUGH education, as participating here, you will more and more experience how these stress factors affects your changes in body composition and performance level. AND, you may, hopefully by this increased knowledge and skills develop your own strategies suited for you body to optimizing your development in military performance and hence operational readiness..


- "click" and hence more likely manage to sustain physical fitness over time, to reduce/ or deley the the drop in fitness during more intense periods/operations and thereby optimizing your operational readiness...

----


- Anyway, these physiological changes will also affect your possibility to develop your military performance, it causes an interference - due to body are not in a homeostatic balance and may not be susceptible for training adaptations


-   All the stressors, point, have negative effects on soldiers performance in the battlefield. As a consequence of all these stressors, it is essential for soldiers to have adequate physical and psychological status to manage all the occupational tasks they have to perform.  

- You need a plan to acconunt for these factors, and you cannot train on all capacitites and military task simuntainously, that may lead to negative development, overreaching and increased risk of getting injured... It has to be a balance between load and restitution...


-   The modern battlefield sets high demands and challenges to soldiers' physical and psycological domains. Even though the development of technology har relieved some of the physical and psychological burden on the battlefield, the overall load placed on soldiers has increased and the time for recovery has decreased.



CONCLUSION her or at the end...:

-   Need for high physical, psycological and cognitive readiness to be successful in their everyday occupational tasks

-   Soldiers need to be in good physical and psycological shape to make decisions quickly and responsible, even when they are in sleep deprivation, energy deficit of physically fatigued. Good physical performance is connected to resilience, as well as psychological and cognitive performance

-   Studies have shown that good physical performance is connected to resilience, as well as psychological and cognitive performance.

-   So, when designing physical training programs for soldiers, it is important to find an optimal balance between physical training and military specific training to avoid overreaching and training interference.



-   A sufficient physical performance level helps the soldier to recover faster and to be more prepared for different tasks.

- ALL THIS SHOULD be carefully considered when trying to plan and implement optimal physical training programs for soldiers.

### First task of reflection: Physical skills and mission ready

**- If you had to lead a mission tomorrow, what physical skills/capacities would you most rely on?**

::: {.notes}

- here I can present the triangle with physical capacities, more capacities, speed, power, coordination, agility, then occupational tasks, then combat ready?..

or wait to the next section....

## Military working demands continues {background-color="#604461"}

- **If you think about your own field of expertise, which work-related demand do you consider the most important or most influential, and why?**
<br>
<br>
     - What makes it stand out compared to other demands?  
     - Which factors are shaping this working demand (technology, environment, speciality, region, country specific etc.)?  

 


::: {.notes}

So these occupational tasks could be translated to your working demands, but what is your most frequent work demands in your specialty... 

Which capacities do these workings demands depend on?


Working demands; can be physical capacitites, or specific tasks ect.

- Lifting weapons, pull push,
- Repetitive movements, loading
- Cognitive sharp

## What Makes a Combat-Ready Soldier? (20 mins) {background-color="#604461"}

### Common combat roles and physical tasks (e.g. carrying gear, movement under fire, tactical obstacles)

Discussion;

**"How does your (the cadet) daily physical training reflect these demands?"**

If not in particular: How can you implement some of these working demand in your training day?


*Coping with the demands*

- What strategies help you handle this demand effectively?

- Can this demand also be seen as an opportunity for your development as a soldier?


::: notes

- what comes first - capacitites or specific training?

- Should include the TRIANGLE here?

- We also know that training on capacities such as strength and endurance will improve these working demands. And maybe evenmore that training on the tasks.. That is because the relative load, percentage of max load, would be reduced, meaning it would be less demanding occupational task....

Five core training principles can guide this process:  

1.\ Load and adaptation – how the body responds to stress  
2.\ Variation – to prevent stagnation and overload  
3.\ Progression – to ensure continuous improvement  
4.\ Specificity – to match training with performance demands  
5.\ **Monitoring and control – to adjust and individualize the plan**

- We have assessment to measure your physical fitness, annual test scores. 
- Its an pass / fail assesment according to a test score /threshold...

- If you are getting stronger or improve your runing time, you are graded higher, usually.
    - This is something we assume, right...

- BUT is this telling us something about your occupational task performance, in for.example digging, evacuation..

- Can we predict your performance from these pass /fail test? 


Or should we, measure your actual performance in digging / evacuation.

- For.example or is our relative strain more important to know? What is this actually costing us to conduct?


Or can two persons with different strength have the opportuninty to perform at the same level in digging? 
    - Technical aspect, work economy - more efficient working?


-----


- Image 1: pass /fail? 

- Image 2/3: percentage of vo2 max/ strength?
    - What is more important for digging performance, strength or endurance? Anyone?
    
    
Is it feasible with the amount of soldiers that need to be tested?

Is it directly transferable to the occupational activity?



- Advanced prediction models?

- Monitor decline in occupational performance? Less efficiency declines over the years in service?

- Should the correlation plot be presented inbetween?

- Evacuation test - one strategy to meet the working demand?

::: notes

Marching, loaded run, repetitive lifting of ammo-boxes, loading ammo?

Unlike age and sex, physical capacity is modifiable, and increased physical capacity can decrease the relative task demands (e.g. % 1RM, % VO2max), and in turn reduce fatigue and MSKI risk [Drain 2019].

**Test fitness**

- Focus: Passing minimum standards (i.e push-ups, sit-ups, run, ball thoss)
- Approach: Train for test-specific drills
-  Outcome: Meets assessment requirements
-  Limitation: Narrow scope, less adaptable
-  Example: 3 km timed run

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Functional fitness**  

- Focus: Real-world readiness, occupational task demands  

- Approach: Train movement patterns (i.e. lift, carry, crawl, sprint)  
- Outcome: Broad performance and injury resilience  
- Limitation: Slower progress on specific test scores  
- Example: Carrying heavy pack uphill - marching

## Test fitness vs- functional fitness (15 mins) {background-color="#604461"}

- Valid predictions?

- To assess an individuals ability to cope with **occupational demands**


::: {.fragment}
- "Evaluation of the effects of physical training programs on occupational task performance, should measure relative strain, such as percentage of maximal capacity, of the participants while performing the task (functional) in addition to the performance outcome (test). 
These data provide more insight into an *individuals* ability to cope with occupational demands."

:::


::: {.notes}

- Strength; Muscle activation - which is feasible? Put on some more measurement equipment, EMG devices? 

Max muscle neural activation (isometric) - dynamic movement muscle activation.


- Endurance: Other measurements your think is relevant

VO2max and crawling - digging (portable vo2 equipment).

:::

## Take aways working demands and tests {.smaller background-color="#604461"}


Key Takeaway:  

- Test fitness = meeting a standard (pass/fail based on a score).  

- Functional fitness = being ready for the unexpected - occupational demand.  
  - Military pentathlon exercises, could some of these exercises be implemented in a test battery to test occupational demands? 


- Best approach: Train to exceed test standards while building functional fitness (specificity), and resilience for real-world battlefield performance.  



Possible solution/suggestion: 

- Make your own test batteries for relevant occupational task?
  - **Then you**, at least, can monitor and control your progression in relevant occupational tasks that you will meet on the battlefield.
  - Control of training progression?
  - Feasible?
  - Motivational?
